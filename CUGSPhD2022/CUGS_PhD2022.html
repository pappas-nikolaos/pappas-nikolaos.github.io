<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >This proposal aims at a joint consideration of information generation, processing, transmission, and reconstruction in
beyond 5G (B5G) massive and mission critical IoT networks by taking into account the age (AoI) and value of
information (VoI). So far, in 5G networks, those processes are treated separately, and the importance and usefulness of
the generated and transmitted information are ignored. In this project will develop theoretical and algorithmic
foundations of goal-oriented, data importance-aware communication to depart from the separated and conventional
content-agnostic paradigm which will help to reveal the potential of future hyperconnected intelligent
systems.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   The main research challenge is how to efficiently operate a massive IoT network, particularly in a mission critical
setup. We will investigate how to get the exact information that is needed where it needs to be, when it needs to be there,
without the tremendous overheads of current systems focused on simply delivering data, with no regard to its value to
the receiving application.

<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >The PhD student will design concrete metrics of assessing information significance. Furthermore, we will develop
multiple access and transmissions schemes. The development of optimal end-to-end information handling schemes will
involve joint information generation, transmission, and reconstruction of processes. The student is expected to have
strong mathematical background in particular on stochastic modelling, optimization, and reinforcement learning. Prior
knowledge on Age and Value of Information will be considered as a big plus. This PhD project consists of the following
work packages.

 id="x1-30002.1"></a>AoI/VoI Metrics</h4>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >We will establish metrics for assessing information significance, such as the AoI/VoI-based metrics. These metrics will
jointly consider information sampling and transmission, which are relevant to smart IoT scenarios. Developing an
AoI to be transmission-aware provides a generalization that departs from the classical evolution of AoI
over time, furthermore, taking into account the evolution of the source goes toward a timing-value aware
metric.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-40002.2"></a>Information generation and transmission</h4>
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >In this part, we will focus on how multiple devices can access a shared medium optimally. When information freshness
is important, we know that the policy of generating traffic at will can be optimal under specific conditions. Thus, we do
not have to retransmit the packets that fail to be received, since a newer sample will be acquired. In that case, sampling
(information generation) must be considered jointly with the transmission, which differentiates our setting
from the classical multiple access schemes such as grant free massive access. Importance-aware access,
where the devices can adapt their transmissions based on the novelty of the acquired sample is another
important direction. This will result to fewer transmissions without sacrificing the reconstructed accuracy
or violating the accuracy requirements when real-time monitoring and reconstruction is the purpose of
communications.
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002.3"></a>Scheduling and resource management</h4>
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >In this part, we will develop optimal end-to-end information handling schemes, which will enable joint information
generation, transmission, and reconstruction of multimodal information. Consider a scenario where multiple sensors
collect similar information; by utilizing smart algorithms, we can prefilter and collect data only from a small subset of
the sensors that when they will be activated, will sustain the required threshold of AoI/VoI. Also, taking into account the
heterogeneity among sensors, the collected data can have different quality in terms of precision or freshness.
Consideration of sampling costs in terms of energy or availability of the observing source is another important aspect to
take into account and it will affect the scheduling and resource management schemes. Consider for example the case
where you can sample from a sensor that has fresh information but of low quality, or you can retrieve less fresh
information but of higher quality. Clearly, the decision of activation will depend on the target we want to
achieve.
